# Bobidi Custom Button (@ Bobidi, Inc)

# 1. Overview

This is a reactive button with gradient graphics and animations created while working at Bobidi, Inc.

# 2. Development Purpose

I wanted to create a trademark that fully encapsulates the unique identity of "Bobidi," so that others could feel the same pride I feel when I hear that name.

My passion for creating this trademark grew when I saw the legacy recording button, and I thought, "How great would it be if this button could represent Bobidi in a small but impactful way?" This inspired me to take action, and I spent my weekends designing and implementing the button.

The button animation was inspired by the iOS video recording button.
